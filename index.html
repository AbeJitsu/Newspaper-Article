      <h1 class="headline">Remembering Ozzy’s Sunlit Spirit</h1>
      <h2 class="sub-headline">Cherished companion leaves a legacy of warmth and gentle wit</h2>
      <p class="author">By Andrea and Abe Reyes</p>
      <p class="text">
        Ozzy, our bright-eyed companion, slipped quietly from our laps two days ago, leaving little pawprints that will never fade. Andrea, his devoted human, and Abe, her husband, still pause to listen for his contented purr—a sound that anchored our home. Ozzy brought a gentle humor to every corner, greeting mornings with whiskered nudges and curling up beside Andrea for late-night reads.

        Though Brenna patrols the windowsills with her spirited grace, she too senses the softer hush without her friend. We choose to remember Ozzy in the sunbeams he loved, paws tucked beneath him, gaze steady and kind. His warmth remains woven into our routines, a reminder that love, once shared, is never truly gone.
